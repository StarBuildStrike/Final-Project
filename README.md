Final-Project
=============

Final Project Ideas: 

1) Windows Media Player & World Language Translator: 

I want to create a media player in Java that is almost identical to Windows Media Player where several types of music and video files can be played. Learning other languages is now in demand nowadays. I wanted to create a language translatting program much like that of a Google Translate that translates English words into different world languages. 

2) Nokia based games: 
In year 2000, a Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia became a hit in several countries in Asia including some of the games that they introduced such as the Snake and Space Impact. I wanted to write a Java project based on those games.

3) Basic Flight Simulator: 
Getting the idea on how to fly is made much easier nowadays. I wanted to create a simple Java project that is based on the actual flight simulator program created by Windows.
