Final-Project
=============

Final Project Ideas: 

1) Windows Media Player: 

I want to create a media player in Java that is almost identical to Windows Media Player where several types of music and video
files can be played. 

2) Nokia based games: 
In year 2000, a Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia became a hit in several countries in Asia especially the games that they introduced
such as the Snake and Space Impact.
